# Complete Logic Gates reference sheet
<pre>
Organized as a hierarchy from root concept down through 5 levels:
</pre>
**Level 1** — Root: The abstract concept of a logic gate as a Boolean function
**Level 2** — Basic Gates: BUFFER, NOT, AND, OR — the foundational primitives
**Level 3** — Compound Gates: NAND & NOR (universally complete), XOR & XNOR
**Level 4** — Multi-input & Special: 3-input AND, IMPLY, Tri-State Buffer, Half Adder
**Level 5** — Reversible/Quantum: Fredkin (CSWAP), Toffoli (CCNOT), CNOT, Peres
**Level 6** — Advanced/Analog: MUX 2:1, DEMUX 1:2, Schmitt Trigger, SR Latch
Each card shows the IEEE gate symbol drawn in SVG, Boolean expression, and truth table. Hover over any gate for a glow highlight.
